This mod makes the camera in <i>Crazy Gadget</i> rotate with the gravity. 🙃

The controls also adjust to gravity. 🎮

The code will not be optimal. 💩

This mod used [Justin113D](https://gamebanana.com/members/1661085)'s 
<u>[FlipScreen](https://gamebanana.com/mods/317917)</u> mod, to tell the 
camera which direction we want to represent up. ⬆️

## Incompatibilities 💔

The FlipScreen mod will **not** work, as both mods are trying to 
take control of the camera at the same place and time.\
Disable FlipScreen and use setting from my mod instead. I stole them all. I 
stole the entire mod. I stole everything. I stole the precious thing.
